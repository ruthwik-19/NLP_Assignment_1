## Project Overview
The main objectives of this project are:
- To build unigram and bigram language models.
- To implement smoothing techniques (Laplace and Add-k) to handle unseen words.
- To use Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) methods to manage unknown words.
- To evaluate model performance using perplexity.
